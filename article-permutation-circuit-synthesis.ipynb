    "The ability to synthesize logical circuits as data structures (without any intention of implementing such circuits as hardware) is becoming increasingly relevant as technologies such as garbled circuit protocols and quantum computing platforms begin to mature. Consequently, there is a growing population working in research, prototyping, and even in software application development settings that may find it convenient to have the ability to synthesize circuits dynamically in popular languages such as Python."

    "This article describes how an embedded language approach coupled with recursion can be used to create a framework that can synthesize a relatively efficient logical circuit for any chosen permutation of the set of all bit vectors of some fixed length. The described approach can actually be applied to the synthesis of a circuit for any function over bit vectors of a fixed length. This article focuses on the case of permutations because it is more challenging to know in advance whether and how circuits that represent a permutation of a space of bit vectors can be optimized, thus motivating a general approach that can produce circuits that may be used directly or as an input to a more specialized circuit optimization process."

    "A naive synthesis approach that utilizes logical formualas can act as a starting point. First, split the permutation $f:\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}^n$ into $n$ separate component functions $\\{f_i \\in \\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\} \\ | \\ i \\in \\{0,\\ldots,n\\}\\}$ such that each component function computes one bit of the output bit vector. For each function $f_i$, convert every input vector $v \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$ that maps to $1$ into a corresponding formula $\\varphi_v$  that is true for exactly that vector. For example, given $(0, 1, 1, 0)$, the formula would be:\n",

Finally, the output $f(v) \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$ of the overall function $f$ on an input vector $v \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$ can be computed by evaluating each of the $n$ formulas on the same input vector:\n",
